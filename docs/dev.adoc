= Developer guide

== Prerequisites

* https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html[JDK 11] or https://jdk.java.net/archive/[OpenJDK 11]
* https://developer.android.com/studio#command-line-tools-only[Android SDK with command line tools] or https://developer.android.com/studio#android-studio-downloads[Android Studio]

== Presentation

The project is organized around 3 distinct git repositories:

* https://github.com/PnX-SI/gn_mobile_core[gn_mobile_core], this current repository which carries "common" and transverse modules (the initial idea was to mutualize common bricks between potentially several applications relying on GeoNature APIs).
* https://github.com/PnX-SI/gn_mobile_maps[gn_mobile_maps], a "generic" cartographic module that has no functional dependency on the "Occtax" application. This module is based on the https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid[osmdroid] Android library.
* https://github.com/PnX-SI/gn_mobile_occtax[gn_mobile_occtax], the functional module for the "Occtax" application, supported by the national parks. This module is based on the two above-mentioned modules via git sub-modules.

== Getting started

We need to clone at least the git repository of the "Occtax" module:

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:PnX-SI/gn_mobile_occtax.git
cd gn_mobile_occtax
git checkout develop
----

As it relies on https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules[git submodules], we also need to retrieve them with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

Symbolic links are automatically resolved.

== Full Build

A full build can be executed with the following command from project root dir:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean assembleDebug
----
